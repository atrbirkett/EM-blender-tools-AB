# Extended Matrix 3D tools for Blender - Fork for Alexander Birkett's PhD

A Fork of the Extended Matrix Blender plugin created by Emanuel Demetrescu adapted to use an alternative set of input nodes in the Extended Matrix yEd Graph, and to produce an alternative certainty colour scheme. This is discussed in further detail in Alexander Birkett's PhD entitled "Virtual Ruins, Real Insights: Establishing A Framework for three-dimensional Modelling in Archaeology".

The website for the official version of EMTools produced by Emanuel Demetrescu [can be found here](http://extendedmatrix.org), and all support and further development should be directed towards his work.
